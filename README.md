# üèà Footballer Network Simulation Project

## üéØ What is This Project?

This project demonstrates **intelligent content-aware networking** using a football theme. It simulates a network where:

- **A sender** transmits data packets containing footballer information
- **A classifier** analyzes each packet and routes it to the correct destination
- **Five receivers** each receive packets meant for their specific footballer:
  - **R1**: Mbappe packets
  - **R2**: Haaland packets  
  - **R3**: Messi packets
  - **R4**: Ronaldo packets
  - **R5**: Neymar packets

Think of it as a **smart mail sorting system** that automatically delivers footballer fan mail to the right person!

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

You need:
- **Linux environment** (WSL on Windows works great)
- **NS-3.45** installed and built
- **g++** compiler with C++20 support

### Step 1: Build the Project

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/CN-ns3-project

# Build both simulations
make -f Makefile-compact compact
```

### Step 2: Run the Simulation

```bash
# Option A: Run the classifier demo (recommended)
make -f Makefile-compact run-classifier

# Option B: Run the simple demo
make -f Makefile-compact run-sim
```

### Step 3: View the Animation

```bash
# Open NetAnim to see the network visualization
netanim compact-football.xml
```

## üéÆ What You'll See

### In the Terminal:
```
AnimationInterface WARNING: Node:0 Does not have a mobility model...
AnimationInterface WARNING: Node:1 Does not have a mobility model...
...
```
*(These warnings are normal - they just mean nodes are stationary)*

### In NetAnim:
- **Circles**: Network nodes (S, C, R1-R5)
- **Lines**: Network connections
- **Moving dots**: Data packets being transmitted
- **Labels**: Node descriptions (Sender, Classifier, Receivers)

## üîç How It Works (Technical Details)

### 1. Packet Creation
```cpp
// Sender creates packets with footballer IDs
FootballerHeader header;
header.SetId(footballerId);  // 0=Mbappe, 1=Haaland, etc.
packet->AddHeader(header);
```

### 2. Classification & Routing
```cpp
// Classifier reads the header and routes accordingly
FootballerHeader header;
packet->RemoveHeader(header);
uint8_t footballerId = header.GetId();
// Send to appropriate receiver based on ID
```

### 3. Packet Reception
```cpp
// Each receiver only gets packets meant for their footballer
if (receivedPacket.footballerId == myFootballerId) {
    processPacket();
}
```

## üìä Network Performance

The simulation tracks:
- **Packets sent** by the sender
- **Packets received** by the classifier  
- **Packets forwarded** by the classifier
- **Packets received** by each receiver
- **End-to-end latency**
- **Network throughput**

## üéØ Available Commands

### Build Commands
```bash
make -f Makefile-compact compact      # Build everything
make -f Makefile-compact clean        # Clean build files
```

### Run Commands
```bash
make -f Makefile-compact run-classifier  # Main simulation (S‚ÜíC‚ÜíR)
make -f Makefile-compact run-sim         # Simple simulation (S‚ÜíR)
```

### Analysis Commands
```bash
python3 compact_analysis.py              # Basic analysis
python3 compact_analysis.py test         # Run all tests
```

## üîß Customization Options

### Change Number of Packets
Edit `compact-classifier.cc`:
```cpp
if(++m_cnt<25)  // Change 25 to your desired number
```

### Change Packet Size
```cpp
auto pkt=Create<Packet>(1024); // Change 1024 to your size
```

### Change Transmission Delay
```cpp
Simulator::Schedule(Seconds(0.1), ...); // Change 0.1 to your delay
```

### Add More Footballers
1. Add to enum: `enum FID {MBAPPE=0,HAALAND,MESSI,RONALDO,NEYMAR,YOURPLAYER};`
2. Update names array
3. Create additional receiver nodes

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**1. "No such file or directory" error**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd /path/to/CN-ns3-project
pwd  # Should show your project path
```

**2. "Library not found" error**
```bash
# Set library path explicitly
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../build/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./compact-classifier
```

**3. "NS-3 not found" error**
```bash
# Make sure NS-3 is built
cd /path/to/ns-3.45
./ns3 configure --enable-examples
./ns3 build
```

**4. NetAnim doesn't open**
```bash
# Check if NetAnim is installed
which netanim

# If not installed:
sudo apt install netanim
```
